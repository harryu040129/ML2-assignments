This repository contains the code for Assignments 1 to 3 from the Machine Learning 2 course at Hanyang University under the Data Science Department. 
These assignments were designed to reinforce theoretical concepts and practical skills in advanced machine learning techniques.

	Assignment 1:
	•	Focus: KNN through For Loops. 
	
	Assignment 2:
	•	Focus: SVM through Pytorch
           Learning how the Pytorch uses its structure to learn the model
           
	Assignment 3:
	•	Focus: Neural networks, especially VGG19 and MobileNet
	         Uses of different ways to combat data imbalance: Weighted Cross entropy, Focal Loss, Up + Downsampling, and Weighted Random Sampling.

Future Update: ameliorated version to be updated for assignment 3.
